We have to design a syntax analyzer which will print whether the inputted program is valid or not.
It will also show the line number in which error occurs.

Steps to implement a file.l and file .y files:

1) bison -d file.l
2) flex file.l
3) gcc lex.yy.c file.tab.c
4) ./a.out

We have given various program inputs you them as input at the end of the file.y file.
       
          fo=fopen("input.txt","r");
                     |
                     |
                 pass input files from here
